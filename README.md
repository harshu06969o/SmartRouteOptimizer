# Adaptive Route Optimizer using Graph Algorithms

This project implements a constraint-aware route optimization system using core graph algorithms such as BFS and Dijkstra.

The goal is to compute optimal paths between locations while handling real-world constraints like blocked routes and multiple starting points.

## Key Features
- Graph-based modeling using adjacency lists
- Shortest path computation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Support for blocked nodes and edges
- Multi-source route optimization
- Path reconstruction (actual route, not just distance)

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Graph Algorithms
- Priority Queues
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Status
Work in progress.
